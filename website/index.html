                    <p class="text-faded">Spanning only 30 in-game days, The C.S. Experience is a short, simulation-RPG hybrid videogame in which players assume the role of a computer science student and are fast-tracked through a single university term that demands them to manage their time, character health, studies and other factors in order to pass their exams. The weeks leading up to each exam period will present the player with a large degree of freedom and should be used to prepare for exams by engaging in character-developing activities. When it is time to write an exam, the player enters a turn-based style combat scenario, similar to Pokemon or Final Fantasy. A well-prepared player, who&rsquo;s improved his or her skills by studying the course material, and has maintained his or her character&rsquo;s happiness, sleep, and hunger values will have an easier &lsquo;combat encounter&rsquo; with the exam, most likely receiving a higher grade.</p>

                                For the most part, the C.S. Experience turned out as we hoped. All of the essential (i.e. high priority) features that were planned made it into the current version of the game. However, not everything was implemented as originally envisioned. Other, less essential features, such as music, an end-game summary, and player customization were pushed to a nebulous "future" release.

                                <br/><br/>

                                The slice-of-life aspect of the game worked out perfectly. Players can choose from a variety of activities including working part time jobs to earn money, studying specific courses to prepare for their exams, and diverse set of methods for maintaining player energy, hunger, and happiness.

                                <br/><br/>

                                The game's save and load features helps support the bite-sized play sessions that are the norm amongst mobile games.

                                <br/><br/>

                                Of all the features, combat may have been the hardest to implement. It is also the one that changed the most. Originally, we planned to incorporate a turn-based combat system where each exam fought back and had its own distinct set of behaviours and abilities. The player would also have his/her own abilities that they would have learned through studying. However, developing all of these aspects of combat alongside the slice of life features proved to be too ambitious. 
                                
                                <br/><br/>

                                Our first iteration was a mix of combat and slice-of-life. We ended up delaying combat to a future release to focus on implementing the slice of life features. After getting a better handle on android studio, we added combat. Currently, combat does not follow a strict turn-based style as exams don't fight back. However, the combat menu retains the spirit of turn-based games visually. In place of a turn-based style, we opted to include a "remaining time" bar to combat, weighing more heavily into the simulation aspect of the game. Combat skills made the final cut as well. As the player studies in the slice-of-life portion of the game, they earn skills which they can use to get higher grades.

                            <h2>What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</h2>

                            <p>
                                We learned that the key to team development is constant communication and knowing our team's limits. 

                                <br/><br/>

                                Throughout each iteration we made heavy use of communication tools such as Slack, with new communication channels for each iteration and other topics, ensuring discussions remained organized. We used this as a space to pitch ideas, discuss problems and work together remotely.

                                Additionally, whenever a new feature or fix was to be added to a branch that more than one person was working on, we opened a merge request in Gitlab so that everyone could review the changes together.

                                <br/><br/>

                                As the iterations progressed, we learned how much was the right amount of work for us to reasonably accomplish. After a bit of work, we would reassess the state of our iteration and decide if we needed to adjust our outcomes, sometimes making the call to delay other features to prioritize others. This sort of adaptability and constant reflection is something that we would like to continue to practice in the future.

                                <br/><br/>

                                One mistake we learned from -- one we will definitely try to avoid in the future -- is to not have the whole team developing the domain specific-objects and logic layer simultaneously without having the object functions and relationships clearly defined beforehand. Instead, it would be best to have a maximum of two developers (pair programming!) lay the ground work early. This would help us avoid the "too many cooks" problem.
                                
                                <br/><br/>

                                In the future we would also like to adapt a "push early, push often" approach to using Gitlab. That is, we would push our individual branches more frequently. This way other group members could review code as it is being developed. This would help us avoid duplicating code and allow everyone to have a better sense of what is currently being worked on.

                                Main conclusion: development is hard.

                                <br/><br/>

                                But that just means that it is worthwhile. 

                                <br/><br/>
                                
                                Developing complicated applications works best when an iterative process is followed. As we developed our game, we made calculated decisions on what to work on and when. We focused on making small chunks work in order to eventually form a cohesive whole.  

                                <br/><br/>

                                Although we knew what we wanted to make at a high level, we did not know exactly how to do it. So, we learned as we went along, and tried to design code that could be extended and repurposed. We think that that is a part of what makes Agile great. By the time an iteration is over, you will have learned something new about your code, your team, and what you're really developing. For us, each retrospective taught us something new and each time we started the next one, we applied what we learned to improve ourselves and our project.
