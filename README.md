# The University Experience Vision Statement

Spanning only 30 in-game days, The University Experience is a short, simulation-RPG hybrid videogame in which players are fast-tracked through a single school term that demands them to manage their time, character health, studies and other factors in order to pass their exams. The weeks leading up to each exam period will present the player with a large degree of freedom and should be used to prepare for exams. When it is time to write an exam, the player enters a turn-based style combat scenario, similar to _Pokemon_ or _Final Fantasy_, but with an added time mechanic. A well-prepared player, who's improved their *skills* by studying the course material, and has maintained their character's happiness, sleep, and hunger gauges reasonably well, will have an easier "combat encounter" with the exam and most likely receive a higher grade.

Entertainment is The University Experience's greatest value. By providing players with challenging exams to combat and only a limited amount of time to execute an effective study regime from a bevy of activities, player's are given the tactical freedom to try out various strategies. An in-game calendar displaying exam dates aids the player in their planning as they can only perform two activities per day. Upon finishing the term, a summary of the player's choices and successes will be presented to them along with a final reward: their term GPA.

The University Experience's second greatest value is its appeal to a wide player base through inclusive features. For instance, rather than developing a virtual analog input for player movment which often feels imprecise on a touchscreen, The University Experience is an entirely-menu based game. This design choice grants several benefits, such as simplicity -- most player's will already have an intuitive understanding how to control other menu-based apps on their phone -- and the ability to play with only one hand. To capitalize on the diversity present amongst mobile gamers, the game will support minor character customization, allowing the player to enter a name for their character and select an avatar for their character from a variety of genders and nationalities. Additionally, difficulty options that determine the number of courses the player character is enrolled in will be available to player, allowing him or her to tailor the game to fit their experience with simulation-RPG games. The game's _day-by-day_ style gameplay, coupled with a "save" feature, enables bite-sized play sessions. For instance, a player can play through a couple of quick days, save his or her progress to be continued later, or, they can play the game in long sessions, working towards long term goals (i.e. the exams).

As a student project, the success of The University Experience will not be determined by how much profit it makes (it will not be sold) or by critical reception (we doubt anyone will take the time to review it). Instead, considering our team's inexperience designing and developing video games, the project will be considered a minor success if the game is playable from start to finish and contains working implementations for roughly 75% of its proposed features. If it is also feature complete, it will be a general success. And, lastly, if it hits the previous criteria and the majority of those who play it (not including the developers) find it fun, it will be considered a major success.
