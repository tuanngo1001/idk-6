## A note for the Marker Regarding Iteration 3:
This iteration added combat mechanics and a suite a of unit, integration, and acceptance tests.

## A Note for the Marker Regarding Iteration 2:
This iteration has greatly expanded the gameplay possible. We are leaving combat or 'exam taking' until version 3. At this point, the game cannot be won or lost, but the 30 day month will still end the game. 

To play, first create a user and start a game. The home page shows your health stats and the date and time. The hamburger in the upper left has options for your consideration. Activities will use a period of time. They have no monetary cost, but will push the time of the game forward. Especially important is studying. Using a period to study a subject will increase your knowledge by one. Buying things from the store will give you health boosts at a price, but take no time to complete. Working a job will earn you money and will use time. The goal of the game is to maintain your player stats while upgrading your academic levels through studying and chegg use. Next iteration will introduce combat, making use of the academic skills upgraded through the game and earning the player points towards their graduation.

## A Note for the Marker Regarding Iteration 1:
Some user stories we had flagged for iteration 1 have been pushed back to iteration 2. These have been tagged with "Delayed-From-Iteration-1". Our initial overestimate of user story goals for iteration 1 is to be expected and we now have a more realistic idea of our abilities as a group. Most of these stories have to do with character evolution and combat skills. While implementing these features takes significant effort, it also requires game design and planning that is more appropriate for a later iteration.

## A Note for the Marker Regarding Iteration 0:
Please note that the issues section of this repo contains _all_ of the user stories for this project. The ones to be implementated in iteration 1 are labelled with the tag `Iteration-1`. All others are works in progress that will be revisited  following iteration 1.
